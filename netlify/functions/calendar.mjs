// Auto-updating iCalendar feed for calendar subscriptions (webcal://).
//
// Unlike the in-app "download" (a one-time snapshot), a subscribed calendar re-fetches
// this endpoint periodically, so newly-final scores show up on their own. Each request
// serves the committed season and best-effort overlays the live ESPN scoreboard on top
// — the same merge the app does — falling back to the committed snapshot if ESPN is down.
//
// This file lives OUTSIDE scripts/, so the "Node built-ins only" refresh-workflow guard
// does not apply: it may import from src/. It reuses the exact same buildIcs/applyLive/
// fetchLive the browser uses, so the subscription and the app can never drift apart.
//
// Netlify Functions v2 (ESM default export). Query: ?teams=MIN,NY filters to those teams.
